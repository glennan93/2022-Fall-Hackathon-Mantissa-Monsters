Project Name: Study Pomodoro Timer
Group Name: Mantissa Monsters
Group Members: Robert Thom, Andrew Glenn

For our project, we decided to create a program that assists users in using their time effectively while studying/working and also allows them to track their time spent on specific courses/tasks. This project was based upon the Pomodoro Technique, a time management strategy that breaks work into intervals ("pomodoros"), typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Technologies used included HTML, CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, ...

Our program main page consists of a timer, a Session Info form, and graph to visually display number of pomodoros completed for each subject/task. The program would also included a login page.

The timer is set to provide 25 minute work intervals and 5 minutes breaks. At the end of a 25 minute work interval, the user is prompted to fill out the Session Info form where they can detail the subject/task of that period as well as comments about what was achieved in that period. This form is disabled during both work and break intervals and only becomes available at the completion of a work interval. 

The graph was created using the Graph.JS library. This graph displays the number of pomodoros completed for each subject/task. The user can select specific date ranges of pomodoro data to display and the graph updates accordingly. The user may also click on the bars of the graph to display the respective pomodoro data retrieved from the database.

Unfortunately, our group had difficulty with the integration of the database system used for storage and retrieval of user data. As such, we were unable to fully implement the program's above-described functionality. Comments have been provided to described what we would have liked to have implemented.
